# Term Project for W4995 Sec:10 Deep Learning. 
The purpose of the project is building a smart trading agent with deep reinforcement learning. We form the financial time series (stock price data) as Markov Descision Proess (MDP). Although the price of $T_{n}$ is not a sufficient statistic of $T_{n+1}$, we can include history data to the process close to MDP.

The agent we build will compete with S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Index in terms of rate of return and Sharpe Ratio, which evalute a trading strategy's return and risk.
